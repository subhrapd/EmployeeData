# EmployeeData
This project involves creating a simple employee database using SQL. The database contains a table named employees, which stores information about employees, including their names, email addresses, departments, and salaries. The project also includes various SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from the table.

Demonstrating the following SQL functionalities:
- Selecting all columns (`SELECT *`)
- Selecting specific columns (`first_name`, `last_name`, `salary`)
- Filtering data using:
  - `WHERE`
  - `AND`, `OR`
  - `LIKE`
  - `BETWEEN`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
- Limiting result count using `LIMIT`
